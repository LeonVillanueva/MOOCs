# neural network -> reduce dimensionality = compression
# auto-encoder : image -> network -> representation
# de-encoder : representation -> network -> image

# de-noising images # r/oldschoolcool

# not a prediction but a utility

# flatten -> linear enconder (single FC) -> specific encoding dimension -> decoder -> original dimension -> compare output with input (same dimensions)
